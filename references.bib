	abstract = {This paper focuses on dynamics of productive and demanding nodes for Scattered Manufacturing Networks within 3D Printings contexts. The various nodes issue orders or sell production slots in order to achieve their own aims. An orchestrator coordinates the dynamics along the network according to principles of sustainability, equated shared resources and transparency by managing communication activities among nodes. In particular, suitable tradeoffs occur by a unique framework that, with the aim of optimizing the overall costs, suggests either logistics paths along the network or negotiation policies among nodes in order to reallocate resources. Numerical examples present the proposed approach.

	abstract = {Many real-world systems problems require reasoning about the long term consequences of actions taken to configure and manage the system. These problems with delayed and often sequentially aggregated reward, are often inherently reinforcement learning problems and present the opportunity to leverage the recent substantial advances in deep reinforcement learning. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization.},

Technologies, such as cloud computing, cloud security, high performance computing, Internet of things which were used to solve the mentioned impediments, were briefly described. Based on it, a new service-oriented networked manufacturing model called Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) was put forward. Then, the concept of CMfg was defined. And differences among CMfg, application service provider and manufacturing grid were discussed. CMfg architecture was also proposed, key technologies for implementing CMfg were studied and preliminary research results were introduced. Finally, an application prototype of CMfg, ie, COSIM-SCP, was presented.},

            Industrie 4.0 aims at improving value chains and value-added networks in industry. Technologically the approach is based on the introduction of cyber-physical systems. Their capabilities form the basis for smart systems. This paper presents technological approaches for Industrie 4.0 and introduces use cases as a specification technique for application scenarios. A demonstrator for additive manufacturing is presented. Lessons learnd from this demonstrator have led to the definition of capabilities for vertical and horizontal integration within Industrie 4.0.},

	abstract = {The German manufacturing industry has to withstand an increasing global competition on product quality and production costs. As labor costs are high, several industries have suffered severely under the relocation of production facilities towards aspiring countries, which have managed to close the productivity and quality gap substantially. Established manufacturing companies have recognized that customers are not willing to pay large price premiums for incremental quality improvements. As a consequence, many companies from the German manufacturing industry adjust their production focusing on customized products and fast time to market. Leveraging the advantages of novel production strategies such as Agile Manufacturing and Mass Customization, manufacturing companies transform into integrated networks, in which companies unite their core competencies. Hereby, virtualization of the process- and supply-chain ensures smooth inter-company operations providing real-time access to relevant product and production information for all participating entities. Boundaries of companies deteriorate, as autonomous systems exchange data, gained by embedded systems throughout the entire value chain. By including Cyber-Physical-Systems, advanced communication between machines is tantamount to their dialogue with humans. The increasing utilization of information and communication technology allows digital engineering of products and production processes alike. Modular simulation and modeling techniques allow decentralized units to flexibly alter products and thereby enable rapid product innovation. The present article describes the developments of Industry 4.0 within the literature and reviews the associated research streams. Hereby, we analyze eight scientific journals with regards to the following research fields: Individualized production, end-to-end engineering in a virtual process chain and production networks. We employ cluster analysis to assign sub-topics into the respective research field. To assess the practical implications, we conducted face-to-face interviews with managers from the industry as well as from the consulting business using a structured interview guideline. The results reveal reasons for the adaption and refusal of Industry 4.0 practices from a managerial point of view. Our findings contribute to the upcoming research stream of Industry 4.0 and support decision-makers to assess their need for transformation towards Industry 4.0 practices.},

It aims to be networked, intelligent, service-oriented, knowledge-based and energy efficient, and promises a variety of benefits and advantages by providing fast, reliable and secure on-demand services for users. It is envisioned that companies in all sectors of manufacturing will be able to package their resources and know-hows in the Cloud, making them conveniently available for others through pay-as-you-go, which is also timely and economically attractive. Resources, e.g. manufacturing software tools, applications, knowledge and fabrication capabilities, will then be made accessible to presumptive consumers on a worldwide basis.

	abstract = {Service provider (SP) know-hows are essential in machining service (MS) encapsulation in the cloud. However, since the acquisition of the know-hows for complex parts machining requires investing considerable manpower and resources in R\&D, this kind of machining know-hows is usually considered as one of the core competences of the SP who makes them unshareable. Targeting the problem, this paper presents a new cloud manufacturing (CM) architecture in which MSs are encapsulated within each SP with standardized machining task description strategies (SMTDS). Only the capability information about what the SP can do is provided to the cloud. During service matching, SMTDS is also applied for user request formulation to improve the matching efficiency and quality. For complex parts in large size, high machining requirements, high value, short delivery cycle, and complex structures, e.g., aircraft structural parts, unacceptable machining quality or delivery delay may cause a much greater loss not only in economy. In the proposed CM architecture, to guarantee the feasibility of the MSs for complex structural parts, machining operations for the user preferred services could be generated by mapping the corresponding typical machining plans (TMP) to the part based on the dynamic feature concept to support accurate evaluations of the MSs. The machining of an aircraft structural part is then applied as a test user request to demonstrate how the proposed method works for finding MS for complex parts.},

It is seen as the winning strategy to be adopted by manufacturers bracing themselves for dramatic performance enhancements to become national and international leaders in an increasingly competitive market of fast changing customer requirements. This paper identifies the drivers of agility and discusses the portfolio of competitive advantages that have emerged over time as a result of the changing requirements of manufacturing. The need to achieve the competitive advantages of manufacturing in synergy and without trade-offs is fundamental to the agile paradigm. To further the understanding of agility, this paper reviews the meaning of agility from different perspectives and suggests a comprehensive definition which can be adopted as a working definition by practitioners. Four underlining concepts of agility has emerged from the working definition and the paper presents a representation of these concepts and their interactions. Finally, the paper highlights some of the key enablers of agility and identifies potential future research directions},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is a networked manufacturing mode that promotes the agile, service-oriented, green and intelligent development of the manufacturing industry. Although some scholars have reviewed related studies of CMfg from multiple perspectives, these reviews are not fully systematic or well justified and fail to fully reveal the key characteristics in the development process of CMfg. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the relevant research on CMfg via identification of key characteristics of definition, architecture, supporting technology and application of CMfg to provide critical information in decision support for the innovation and development of CMfg.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study systematically reviews the relevant research on CMfg across theoretical methods to technical applications by integrating quantitative and qualitative methods. Word cloud method is used to quantitatively analyse the structure and feature of different definitions of CMfg. The principle of System Science is used to explore the basic components and functions of various CMfg architectures and their common and differing characteristics. A multi-level technology framework is developed to explore the development status of CMfg supporting technologies. A multi-stage application classification is proposed to reveal the application status of CMfg.
            
            
              Findings
              Through literature review, this study found that CMfg architecture is currently dominated by general architectures and lacks architectures that fit the actual enterprise characteristics; CMfg supporting technology is mature in the traditional cloud computing-based technology, but it is still weak in the development of virtualization and servitization technology, service scheduling technology; CMfg application is still in the initial stage and still lacks a relatively complete system application. By analysing the development status of CMfg, this study also identified potential research directions of CMfg in information management, service composition and evaluation, system application and sustainable development and other aspects.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              This paper predominantly focuses on journal articles and some key conference papers published in English and Chinese. Chinese articles account for more than half of the total. The reason is that CMfg was proposed by the Chinese and CMfg is suitable for the development of China's manufacturing industry because of China's intelligent manufacturing environment. It is believed that this research has reached a reliable comprehensiveness that can help scholars and practitioners establish new research directions and evaluate their work in CMfg.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Prior literature reviews ignore the identification and analysis of key feature identification for the current development of CMfg, including common and unique feature identification of different CMfg architectures and functions, multi-layer analysis and interpretation of CMfg technology and different stage analysis of CMfg applications. This study addresses these limitations and provides a comprehensive literature review.},
